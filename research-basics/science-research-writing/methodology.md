# Writing about Methodology

![](TIM截图20200521224127.png)

## Structure

这部分不同的学科，不同的期刊名字会有所不同，有：

- Materials and Methods
- Procedure
- Experiments
- Experimental
- Simulation
- Methodology
- Model

这里是核心report部分的第一part，第二part是results，这一part主要汇报做了什么还有用了什么。

大多数期刊会公布一个Guide，这里面会对各部分有一些简单的要求。对于methodology部分，通常会提到要提供足够多的细节，以使工作能够被重现。但是这部分写作不仅仅使记录做了什么。面对的读者可能对方法并不足够了解，要能使方法的信息让每个读到它之后都能执行它并获得相似的结果，还能理解并接受其过程。

首先，先问三个问题：

- 如何开始 Methodology/Experiments section? 用什么类型的句子开头?
- 这部分应该用什么类型的信息，以什么样的顺序展开？
- 如何结束这一部分？

因为methodology这部分要包括自己做了什么的详细描述，所以第二个问题就有了一部分答案，当然这还不够，接下来先看看语法和技巧。

## Grammar and Writing Skills

在methodology中有三个语言方面的内容需要注意：

- PASSIVES AND TENSE PAIRS
- USE OF ‘A’ AND ‘THE’
- ADVERBS AND ADVERB LOCATION

### 被动语态，时态比较

主动语态被动语态的例子：

- The dog bit the policeman.              active 
- The policeman was bitten by the dog.    passive

不过写学术论文的时候，当把主动语态转为被动语态时，并不使用by us或by me这种说法。所以更像这种：

- We/I collected the samples.           active
- The samples were collected.           passive

在开始写做了什么之前，应该检查下目标期刊的Giude for Authors，来检查下应该用主动语态，还是被动语态来写。一般情况下，都要用被动语态来写，时态通常使一般现在时，或者一般过去时。

使用被动语态时有两种常见的错误。

首先，看两个句子：

- (a) A flexible section is inserted in the pipe.    Present Simple passive 
- (b) A flexible section was inserted in the pipe.   Past Simple passive

写作的时候要能区别一般流程是什么，以及自己做了什么。比如上面句a，用一般现在时，就是描述了什么是normally done的，而句b用一般过去时就是描述了自己做了什么。

当然两句都是被动语态，且不用指定主语，因此时态就特别重要了，指出哪些是自己做的，哪些是一般的过程。所以时态不正确会让人很疑惑。

另外，当时态是一般过去时时，也有可能无法区分自己做的还是其他研究者做的。强调自己工作的一种方法是加 in this study, in our experiments 这样的话。

小结下刚提到的几种情况：

||想要表达的内容|论文中要这样表达|
|-|-|-|
|1|X was (collected/ substituted/ adjusted etc.) by me in the procedure or work that I carried out|Either move to the active (We collected/adjusted/ substituted etc.) or add words or phrases such as here/in this work/in our model or use a ‘dummy’ subject such as This experiment/The procedure|
|2|X was (collected/ substituted/ adjusted etc.) by the person whose procedure or work I am using as a basis for, or comparing with, my own|Give a research reference and/ or add words/phrases such as in their work/in that model|
|3|X is (collected/substituted/ adjusted etc.) normally, i.e. as part of a standard procedure|You may need a research reference even if it is a standard procedure, depending on how well- known it is. Use phrases such as as|
|4|X is (collected/substituted/ adjusted etc.) as you can see in Fig. 1, but it was collected/ substituted/adjusted etc. by me|Move to the active (We collected/adjusted/substituted etc.) if you can or make sure that you come out of the Present Simple passive when you stop describing the figure|
|5|X is (collected/substituted/ adjusted etc.) by me in the procedure/work that I carried out, but my fi eld requires authors to write procedural descriptions in the Present Simple tense. (Th is is quite common in pure mathematics)|Either move to the active (‘We collect/adjust/substitute etc.) or add words or phrases such as here/in this work/
in our model or use a ‘dummy’ subject such as Th is experiment/The procedure|

简单概括下，

- 当想说“我做了什么”时，要写“在本研究中”
- 当想说“别人做了什么，我用”的时候，要给一个引用，或者写“在他们的工作中”
- 当想说“某个步骤是常规步骤”时，要引用，或者用as这样的句子
- 当停止描述figure时，要从一般现在被动语态出来
- 需要用一般现在时来描述自己的动作时，用“在我们的模型中”之类

### Use of ‘a’ and ‘the’

a 和 the 的区别是英语语法使用中经常遇到的问题。单数的可数名词是需要限定词的，但是限定词有：the, a, my, this, one, some. 到底什么情况下用什么，有两个问题需要考虑。首先，哪些名词是可数的？然后，用a还是the？

先看第一个问题。可数不可数并不那么容易，因为有些平常被认为不可数的也可能有可数的使用情况。比如：There have been three deaths this year from pneumonia. 所以当对一个词，比如industry，要考虑下是意味着一般意义的工业（不可数），还是一个特定的工业（可数）。

第二个问题，使用a还是the？泛指还是特指并不是一个很好的分界的方法。应该考虑这样的问题：为什么第一次说一些事的时候用a，而当再次指代它时会用the？比如：I had a cheese sandwich and an apple for lunch. The sandwich was fine but the apple had a worm in it.

区别在于第一次说的时候只有说的人自己知道，但是第二次说的时候说者和听者就都知道了，而其中出现的worm对于听者则是第一次出现，所以用a。因此，这里对a还是the，可以总结一条规则：USE **THE** IF OR WHEN YOU AND YOUR READER BOTH KNOW WHICH THING/PERSON YOU MEAN. 也就是只要读者和作者都知道的东西，无论第几次出现，都是the，比如：I bought a new computer but the keyboard was faulty. 因为电脑已经提到了，所以键盘自然是被想到的事情。

还有一些更有用的规则：USE **THE** IF THERE IS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE REFERENT

比如：Cairo is the capital of Egypt.

USE **A** IF IT DOESN’T MATTER or YOU DON’T KNOW or YOUR READER DOESN’T KNOW WHICH THING/ PERSON YOU ARE REFERRING TO.

比如：A 35 ml brown glass bottle was used to store the liquid. (It doesn’t matter which 35 ml brown glass bottle was used.)

有时，a和the表达的意思是完全不同的，比如：

- (a) Th is eff ect may hide a connection between the two. (There may possibly be a connection between the two but if there is, we cannot see it.) 
- (b) Th is eff ect may hide the connection between the two. (There is definitely a connection between the two but we may not be able to see it because of this effect.)

还有（∅ is used here to indicate the plural of a）：

- (a) The nodes should be attached to ∅ two adjacent receptor sites. (There are many receptor sites and any two adjacent ones will do.)
- (b) The nodes should be attached to the two adjacent receptor sites. (There are only two receptor sites.)

另一个要注意的点是 a，the以及 ∅ 都可以用来表示一个general的事实：

- The electroencephalograph is a machine for measuring brain waves.
- An electroencephalograph is a machine for measuring brain waves. 
- Electroencephalographs are machines for measuring brain waves.

最后一点，用于元音名词之前时，a要用an替代，注意不是字母拼写，而是发音，比如：an MRI scan，因为M的发音是“em”，还有 a UV light，U的发音是“yoo”

### Adverbs and adverb location

副词的错误是不那么容易被发现的，因为语法上可能没有错误，而是在意义上词不达意。副词的位置有时会产生歧义，比如(Look at that dog with one eye can either mean USING one eye or HAVING one eye)，第二，副词会附加到句子意料之外的部分，因此要小心副词的位置，尤其是一个句子中用到连续多个副词时。比如：He gave a lecture about liver cancer at the hospital last January. 这是说lecture还是cancer在医院里？是cancer cases发生在一月还是lecture发生在一月？

副词位置有一些规则，但是很复杂，使用不便。所以为了方便，还是尽量避免多个副词聚集在一起，调整下顺序。如果副词关系到整个句子，可以考虑放到句首，比如：Last January he gave a lecture about liver cancer at the hospital，如果还是觉得有歧义，可以考虑将句子分开：Last January he gave a lecture at the hospital; his subject was liver cancer

## Writing Task: Build a Model

现在考虑给methodology创建一个模板了。创建了模板之后，就可以结合Key来实战了。

同样地，模型只有能用到其他方面时候才有用，所以不要包含具体的专业词汇。

找出每一句中作者做了什么的一种方法是可以想象拿掉这一句，会对全文产生什么样的影响，然后这句话再重新出现，对这句话又有什么样的认识。

第二种方法是用查看语法和词汇，主要动词的时态是什么？最常用的时态是什么？和前面句子的时态一致么？如果不一致，为什么会改变时态？作者选择用了哪些词？

模板没有银弹，在查看Key之后，会不断修改。

### 第一句

The current investigation involved sampling and analysing six sites to measure changes in groundwater chemistry. 

先是自己的分析：

用了一般过去时，说明是自己做的内容，用了一系列详细的动作词--sampling, analysing, measure等来表达做什么。

这句话如果没有了，那么后面显然就不知所云了，提纲挈领的一句，这句话又重新加上，就可以看到第二局很顺利地承接了这一句。

Key:

作者给出了一个**general overview of the entire subsection, including the purpose of the investigation**。

这是一个对methodology的一个introduction。有时候，有的作者回立刻给出一个materials的整体描述，这在research focus比较narrow，且读者都是熟悉自己领域的时候是合适的，更多时候更友好的一种方式是以introductory material开头较好，其目的是让读者能够平滑地进入到methodology这一部分。介绍methodology常用方式有三种：

- 给出一个general overview，列出自己工作的参数，比如测试的数目，the equipment /material/soft ware used 还有 the purpose of the investigation. 这些能帮助读者快速的获取这一部分的 general idea
- 提供关于the materials的背景信息，或者materials/equipment的来源
- 回顾之前部分提到的内容，通常回选择重述下工作的目的作为开头

这种top-down的顺序基本上是大家都会选择的方式，而不会去选择bottom-up的方式。Remember: show your reader the wall before you begin to examine the bricks.

### 第二句

The sites were selected from the London Basin area, which is located in the south-east of England and has been frequently used to interpret groundwater evolution$^{2,3,4}$.

先是自己的分析：

首先，用了一般过去被动语态，表明是自己的选择；还有从句，从句中是一般现在时，表示一个常识内容；还有现在完成时，表示到现在这是一种常用的方法，因此有一些引用来支撑自己的说法。

如果没有这句话，似乎还是能读下去，并没有像第一句影响这么大，说明这是一个对第一句的补充，我想这也是前两句分段在一起的原因；再重新加回这句话，能让我们了解更多关于sites的内容。

Key：

**提供背景信息，并通过引用别人的工作来佐证自己的选择**。

为什么要佐证自己的选择？

因为对于读者来说，他需要知道为什么要这样选择，否则他们会有疑惑，这样就很难接受自己的工作。

许多人认为这一节只是对所做或使用的事情的客观描述；但事实上，这一小节是有很强的说服和沟通的因素的。我们不仅在诸如“thoroughly”或“with care but”这样的语言中看到这一点，而且在佐证自己选择的频率上也看到了这一点。描述自己的方法时，不仅仅要说明**This is exactly what I did/used**，还要说明**I had good reasons for those decisions**。

有时候会用背景信息来佐证选择，比如因为其某些特性而选择某种特定的材料，这时候要描述清楚这些属性是什么。

### 第三句

A total of 18 samples was collected and then analysed for the isotopes mentioned earlier.

自己分析：

一般过去时，表面自做；然后这句话同样也是段首提纲挈领，没有它，后面的句子是不通的。

Key：

**提供了对方法或过程本身的overview**

每一段第一句通常都意味着开启了新主题，且这句提供一个introductory的作用。做到让作者和读者有共同的图景。这样的句子通常以这样的短语开始：Most of the tests 或者 In all cases

### 第四句

Samples 1–9 were collected in thoroughly-rinsed 25 ml brown glass bottles which were filled to the top and then sealed tightly to prevent contamination. 

自己分析：

这句全是一般过去时，更加详细地用一系列动词来表明自己做了什么；没有这句话对前句没有进一步交待，后句主语也没有所指了，是一句承上启下的句子。

Key：

**提供关于做了什么，用了什么的信息，并表明采取了谨慎的措施**

那么需要细节到什么程度？如果不确定读者是否完全熟悉自己的细节，那就要尽可能地给出更多详细的内容。如果想要让别人能很好地复现自己的结果，那么尽量详细是比较好的。

另外，就是用了thoroughly, filled to the top 以及 tightly 这类词来和读者交流，这是在向读者表明自己采取了谨慎的措施。因为这是为了让读者能更好地接受自己地结果，而接受结果地前提就是要接受自己地方法。

### 第五句

The filled bottles were shipped directly to two separate laboratories at Reading University, where they were analysed using standard methods suitably miniaturised to handle small quantities of water. $^5$

自己分析：

仍然是自己做的内容的阐述，一个从句来给出更多信息。用bottles这个中心词来承接上句。到此，完成一个段落，应该也是避免段落过长。

Key：

**继续描述做的内容的细节，仍然用谨慎的语言交流**

### 第六句

Samples 10–18 were prepared in our laboratory using a revised version of the precipitation method established by the ISF Institute in Germany.$^6$

自己分析：

完成对第三句的呼应，作为新一段的开端句。

Key：

**通过引用文献中的现存方法来描述自己做了什么**

引用文献的原因是通常情况下，一篇文章都不会从头到尾创建一个新方法，基本都是在别人研究的基础上进一步完善的，所以引用别人的内容，这样就不用给出过多的细节。

但是为什么给了引用还要自己再描述下方法呢，为什么读者不去自己找那些文献呢？

因为让读者去找论文不是太合适，并且描述即便是和之前的方法相同的过程，实验，材料等，也是一种科研上的约定俗成。注意用一般现在时来和自己的工作一般过去时区分开就行了。

让读者能区分出自己所做和别人所做的区别也是一项很重要的工作。是和前人完全相同，是相似，还是完全不同，这意味着这篇文章的贡献有多少。

还有有一些methodology的细节会在results阶段才提及，而在methodology部分只提供一些基本的参数，更多细节会在results部分进一步展开。

### 第七句

This method obtains a precipitate through the addition of BaCl2.2H2O; the resulting precipitate can be washed and stored easily.

同样是对第六句的补充。不过需要注意时态变了，使用的是一般现在时，说明是对已有的方法的一个阐述。

Key：

**提供关于方法更详细的信息，说明它是一个好的选择**

佐证是贯穿这一部分的事情，其目的是回答可能存在的质疑，保证读者认可作者所作的选择。

### 第八句

The samples were subsequently shipped to ISF for analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS).

自己分析：

又是新一段的提纲挈领句，是对第三句完成之后的下一步的内容的说明，也是自己做的内容。

Key：

**提供关于方法的更多细节**

### 第九句

All tubing used was stainless steel, and although two samples were at risk of CFC contamination as a result of brief contact with plastic, variation among samples was negligible.

自己分析：

补充第八句。

Key：

**提到了方法中可能会遇到的困难**

如果完全不提及自己方法的不足，可能意味着你自己不清楚它的问题，这样并不好，所以更专业的做法是提及它们。

另外，这次遇到的问题也是下次改进的重要方向。

但是要注意要说明这些问题不会对现在的结果造成致命影响，所以可以用一些词汇来表达：minimises the problem, minimises your responsibility, maximises the good aspects 还有 suggests a solution 等。

最后汇总一下methodology这部分的model：

- In Sentence 1 the writer offers a general overview of the subsection.
- In Sentence 2 the writer provides background information and justification.
- In Sentence 3 the writer provides an overview of the procedure/method itself.
- In Sentence 4 the writer provides details about what was done and used and shows that care was taken.
- In Sentence 5 the writer continues to describe what was done in detail, using language which communicates that care was taken.
- In Sentence 6 the writer describes what was done by referring to existing methods in the literature.
- In Sentence 7 the writer provides more detailed information about the method and shows it to have been a good choice.
- In Sentence 8 the writer provides more details of the method.
- In Sentence 9 the writer mentions a possible difficulty in the methodology.

总的来说是四个方面

1. 
    - PROVIDE A GENERAL INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE MATERIALS/METHODS 
    - RESTATE THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK 
    - GIVE THE SOURCE OF MATERIALS/EQUIPMENT USED 
    - SUPPLY ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2. 
    - PROVIDE SPECIFIC AND PRECISE DETAILS ABOUT MATERIALS AND METHODS (i.e. quantities, temperatures, duration, sequence, conditions, locations, sizes)
    - JUSTIFY CHOICES MADE 
    - INDICATE THAT APPROPRIATE CARE WAS TAKEN
3. RELATE MATERIALS/METHODS TO OTHER STUDIES 
4. INDICATE WHERE PROBLEMS OCCURRED

可以从这个model中选择对自己有用的部分，不用完全按照这个model来行文。

### INDICATE THAT APPROPRIATE CARE WAS TAKEN

提供一些形容词、副词来帮助构建句子时有足够的灵活性。

### RELATE MATERIALS/METHODS TO OTHER STUDIES

说明哪些部分是和别人一样的，哪些地方是有所不同的。

### INDICATE WHERE PROBLEMS OCCURRED

这部分主要是最小化问题，最小化自己的责任，而且最大化自己的好的方面，及对问题的解决方案。
